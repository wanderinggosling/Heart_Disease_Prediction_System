            <h1>===About Heart Disease===</h1>
            <p>Heart disease is a term used to describe a range of conditions that affect the heart. It is the leading cause of death worldwide, with more than 17 million deaths per year. The following are some of the key parameters used to diagnose and treat heart disease:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chest pain (also called angina): This is a common symptom of heart disease and occurs when the heart does not get enough oxygen-rich blood.</li>
                <li>Blood pressure: High blood pressure (also called hypertension) can damage the arteries and lead to heart disease.</li>
                <li>Cholesterol: High levels of cholesterol in the blood can cause the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to heart disease.</li>
                <li>Fasting blood sugar (FBS): High levels of FBS can be a sign of diabetes, which is a risk factor for heart disease.</li>
                <li>Resting electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG): This test measures the electrical activity of the heart while the patient is at rest and can help diagnose heart disease.</li>
                <li>Slope of the peak exercise ST segment: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment refers to the direction and steepness of the ST segment on an ECG during an exercise stress test, and can provide important information about the extent and severity of any blockages or narrowing in the coronary arteries.</li>
                <li>Stress test: This test measures the heart's response to exercise and can help diagnose heart disease.</li>
                <li>No of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy: The number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy refers to the number of coronary arteries that show significant narrowing or blockage during a cardiac catheterization procedure, and helps diagnose and guide treatment for coronary artery disease.</li>
                <li>Oldpeak ST depression: Oldpeak ST depression, also known as exercise-induced ST depression, is a common finding in electrocardiogram (ECG) readings taken during exercise stress testing. It refers to the downward displacement or depression of the ST segment in the ECG tracing that occurs during the recovery period after exercise. </li>
                <li>Thalassemia: Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. Individuals with thalassemia have a defect in one or more of the genes that control the production of hemoglobin, resulting in decreased production of the protein.</li>
